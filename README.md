# 🛒 Multi-Cloud Microservices E-commerce Platform

A modern e-commerce platform built with microservices architecture, demonstrating real-world DevOps practices across multiple cloud providers.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project demonstrates how to build, deploy, and manage a scalable e-commerce platform using:

- **Microservices**: Small, focused services that work together
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployments
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration and management
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code
- **GitOps**: Automated deployment workflows
- **Multi-Cloud**: AWS (primary) + Azure/GCP (backup)

## 📱 Services

- **Product Service**: Product catalog and inventory management
- **User Service**: User authentication and profile management
- **Order Service**: Order processing and payment handling
- **Notification Service**: Email and SMS notifications
